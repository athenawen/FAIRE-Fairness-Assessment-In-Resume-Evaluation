# Assessing Racial and Gender Bias in AI-Driven Resume Evaluations: A Comparative Study of LLMs
## Testing
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook originally developed in Google Colab that demonstrates techniques for analyzing bias in resume evaluations. The project explores data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis to uncover potential biases in how resumes are assessed.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Required libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

(and any other libraries used in the notebook)

### Installation
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/resume-bias-test.git
cd resume-bias-test
```

Install the required Python packages:

You can install the dependencies using pip (assuming you have a requirements.txt file):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you don’t have a requirements.txt, you can install the libraries individually:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
Open the Notebook:

- Open the file in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab).

Run the Notebook:

Execute the cells sequentially to:

- Load the resume data.

- Analyze the data.
